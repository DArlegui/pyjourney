# Python Journey

My own exercises answers from ***Python Crash Course* (Eric Matthes)**. Each script is standaloneâ€”run them directly to see output.

## Concepts Learned

* Core Python syntax (numbers, strings, lists, dicts, sets)
* Control flow (loops, conditionals)
* Functions and OOP
* File I/O and exceptions
* Small utilities (comprehensions, `string` module, randomness)
* Early testing patterns
